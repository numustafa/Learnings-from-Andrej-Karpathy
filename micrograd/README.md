This is based on the first video of Andrej karpathy. This lecture involves learnings of basic mathematical functions in NN and Backpropagation, using micrograd lib. This lib starts from the basics (scalars) and later once all the mathematics be applied on the scalers, the concepts then be studies to implement the samilar mathematical properties over multi-dim tensore, typically used in Pytorch or JAX.
